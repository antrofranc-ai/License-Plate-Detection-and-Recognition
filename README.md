# License-Plate-Detection-and-Recognition
License plate detector and recognizer using yolov4 and tesseract.
## Inroduction
The aim of this project is to detect and recognize number plates in a live or captured video. 
The model is trained over 2000 epochs on 671 vehicle images and bounding box coordinates.
The output is the frame of detection, the cropped image of the license plate and the characters on the license plate.
## Main Technologies
* Yolov4
* Tesseract
* Opencv
