# License-Plate-Detection-and-Recognition
License plate detector and recognizer using yolov4 and tesseract.
## Inroduction
The aim of this project is to detect and recognize number plates in a live or captured video. 
The weights for detection are trained over 2000 epochs on 671 images of vehicles with coordinates of the bounding boxes.
## Main Technologies
